2. Get to know about predicate programming guide - https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Predicates/AdditionalChapters/Introduction.html
3. Familiarize with https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Contacts/Reference/CNContact_Class/index.html

## Instructions
1. Mac with Yosemite or El Capitan is needed
2. Validate if you have the Xcode setup.  Atleast Xcode 7.2 The sample code for this project was written using Xcode version 7.2.1.  If Xcode is not installed, download and install it from Mac app store https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12 
3. Dowload the project from https://github.com/psenthil/groupmessage/archive/master.zip . Alternatively you can download the code by opening up Terminal app and use git clone  https://github.com/psenthil/groupmessage.git to download in your favorite folder. 
4. Locate GroupMessage.xcodeproj from the folder from the downloaded location.
5. Double click on the GroupMessage.xcodeproj file and it should open up the project in Xcode
6. Once opened, make sure to select a simulator device and click on Play button  as show in the [screenshot] (https://github.com/psenthil/groupmessage/blob/master/xcode_project_view.png)
7. It should start the app after installing in the simulator. First run might take a bit longer and the subsequent runs will be faster. It should show the [first screen](https://github.com/psenthil/groupmessage/blob/master/screen1.png)
8. Going back to Xcode and clicking on the ViewController.swift will provide the glimpse of the program
