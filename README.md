2. Get to know about predicate programming guide - https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Predicates/AdditionalChapters/Introduction.html
3. Familiarize with https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Contacts/Reference/CNContact_Class/index.html

## Instructions
1. Validate if you have the Xcode setup.  Atleast Xcode 7.2 . The sample code for this project was written using Xcode version 7.2.1. 
2. Needless to say a Mac that runs Xcode 7.2 (Yosemite or El Capitan) is needed
3. Download the code by opening up Terminal app and use git clone  https://github.com/psenthil/groupmessage.git to download in your favorite folder
4. Locate GroupMessage.xcodeproj from the folder where the repository was cloned.
